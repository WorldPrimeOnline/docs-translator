## Decisions

### 2026-06-25 — CLAUDE.md is a compact bootloader, not the full project knowledge base

**Decision:**
`CLAUDE.md` must stay compact and contain only global operating rules, critical safety constraints, mandatory read-first instructions, and the context map. Detailed knowledge lives in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `docs/ai-context/*.md`.

**Rationale:**
The previous `CLAUDE.md` exceeded 40,000 characters and mixed operational rules with detailed architecture documentation. Splitting the context into routed markdown files keeps startup context small while preserving detailed knowledge in version-controlled docs.

**Impacted files/docs:**
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- `docs/ai-context/INDEX.md`
- `docs/ai-context/*.md`

**Risks / caveats:**
Claude must actually read `INDEX.md` and the relevant context files before risky work. The end-of-task context maintenance check (see `docs/ai-context/96_CONTEXT_MAINTENANCE_RULES.md`) is required to prevent the docs from becoming stale.
